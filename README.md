#I’ve decided to create a GUI application that determines who the greatest rapper of All time is. The name with be “The G.O.A.T”. The purpose of the application is to determine who has had the greatest career and lyrics over the past 50 years.
I am creating the application because there are thousands of Beast rapper lists. Because of the age range of listeners, there is quite a bit of debate. If a person was born in the 2000’s they wouldn’t know the effect certain artists had prior.
My target audience is 12-60 year olds. All races, nationalities, genders, and location. Because rap music has grown so large, its hard to only have one specific criteria. Every socioeconomic status, every state, etc.
How the application will work:
1.	User enter age, gender and location
2.	Users are asked to enter the names of their top 5 artists of all time
3.	User will be asked to enter 2 bars from said artists that they consider elite
4.	When user clicks submit, the second window will display the average of the entire rating system
